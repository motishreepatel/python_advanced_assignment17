    "data types more easily during parsing operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Advanced parsing operations: The Scanner interface offers additional functionality for parsing, such as skipping patterns, setting \n",
    "custom locale and radix, and retrieving match results. It allows you to perform more complex parsing operations beyond simple matching \n",
